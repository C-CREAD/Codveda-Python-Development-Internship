Task 1: Django Web Application with Authentication
Build a fully functional web application using Django that includes
user authentication (login, registration, and password reset).
The application can be a blog, task manager, or e-commerce site

Objectives:
✅ - Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality.
✅ - Secure user passwords using Django’s built-in authentication system.
✅ - Create user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) with different permissions.
✅ - Integrate password reset functionality via email.
     NOTE: To ensure this feature works, all admin/non-admin users must be registered with a valid email address.


1. Navigate to the terminal, then go the 'task_manager' directory where manage.py resides.

2. Run the following commands in order:
   a) - pip install -r requirements.txt
   b) - python makemigrations tasks
   c) - python manage.py migrate
   d) - python manage.py createsuperuser
        (Enter your admin credentials)
   e) - python manage.py runserver

3. Create your .env file according to the .env.example format. (Required for accessing Password Reset Feature)

4. Go to the browser and access the following link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

5. Login to the website with either the admin, or non-admin credentials below:
    (ADMIN)
    username = admin
    password = adm1n

    (NON-ADMIN)
    username = wes
    password = wes

NOTE: Some features of the project are admin-only, thus logging in as a non-admin user will show fewer features.
